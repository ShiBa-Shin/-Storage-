# About this repo

I'm not the kind of guy who organize everything but I do hate to find something again once I've owned. So here we are.

Sometimes you lose your stuff (accidentally?) and when you try to get them back, there're gonna be so many tedious works to do. NOPE! That's not the idea.

It's not like I got some rare stashes in here. They're just some common shits which to help me to do a better work. I won't podcast this repo but maybe you'll find something useful in here someday.

BTW, why am I even bother to write this? It's because I like keep training my English and it doesn't look cool for a repository without a 📝README.

_Also, **🤘MARKDOWN ROCKS!!!🤘**_
